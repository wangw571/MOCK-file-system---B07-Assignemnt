	and file type
17	As a user, my intention is to view subfile/folder as simple as possible,    	0
	presenting the entire file relation as a tree, which every subfile/folder is 
	at the right bottom of its parent, subfile/folder in the same level meaning 
	they have a same parent                                                    
18	As a user, I want to use redirection to capture the output of every command 	5
	and redirect it to a file and no output is shown to me. But all errors are 
	still displayed on the console.

	all the files in a directory. I want to get the matching lines in the files. 
	For more than one file, lines will be displayed to me in the following way: 
	the path to the file (including the filename), then a colon, then the line 
	that contained the regular expression.
