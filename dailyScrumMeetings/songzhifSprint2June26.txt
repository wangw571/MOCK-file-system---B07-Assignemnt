Each one of you is responsible for adding a file in this folder every three days with the
following contents: Do not ask your colleague to commit for you. That won't count. 

a) What did I work on last time? 
	Update Command class:
		add the check-input function for every sub-command class, the function takes string array
		as input and returns a boolean variable.  the Command class is calling those check-input
		function( I work very hard on this part to make it work, which executes a function calling
		those check-input methods by only know the string of their class name) then use the same
		way calling the execute method.
	
	From sprint 2:
		Continue to adapt JShell to new command
		b-1:(Pushd) implement directory STACK (LIFO)  --->Kyle
		c-1:(History) create an abstract data type: History       ---> Kyle
		c-3:(JShell/Command) declare a History object and listen/collect every command input

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
		b-2:(Pushd) push current working directory to stack       --->Kyle
		b-3:(Pushd) using arguement directory to call cd command       --->Kyle
		b-4:(Popd) return, pop from directory stack           ---> Kyle
		b-5:(Popd) using directory poped from directory stack call cd command          ---> Kyle
		

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
		N/A
