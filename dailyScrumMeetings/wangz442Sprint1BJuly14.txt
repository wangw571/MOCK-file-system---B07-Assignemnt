What did I do last time?
    - My task for sprint1: (Exception Classes) Build classes to custom exceptions
   	  refer on the slides on exception
   	- design custom exception class

What do I plan to do now?
    - I need to talk with the other 3 teammates who already finished the class on
      how to write the exception cases
    - Build interface on exception solution for each class

Am I blocked on anything?
    - N/A
