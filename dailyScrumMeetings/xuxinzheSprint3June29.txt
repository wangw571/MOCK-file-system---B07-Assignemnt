What did I do last time?
    - designed new CRC Cards for new classes with teammates
    - added print and log funtions to History command class
    - created new sprint3 backlog with teammates

What do I plan to do now?
    - declare a History object and collect every command input
    - display the entire file system as a tree
    - handle errors

Am I blocked on anything?
    - wait for tasks f-1 and f-2 to be completed
