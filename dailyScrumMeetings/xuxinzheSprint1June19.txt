What did I do last time?
    - learned about assignment requirements
    - discussed connection between my task and teammates' tasks
    - brainstormed design ideas with team for pwd command.
    - implemented basic structure of pwd command 

What do I plan to do now?
    - finish part of pwd command which doesn't need to be based on MOCK and Command
    - work on new tasks for sprint 2

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need MOCK and Command to be completed before I can continue working on pwd
