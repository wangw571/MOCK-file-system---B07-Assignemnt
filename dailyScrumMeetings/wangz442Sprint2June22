What did I do last time?
   - finish cd, echo command with Qingtian Wang
   - talk the MOCK system written by Qingtian Wang
   - because different command written by different member shares some commmon function,
     in order to be more readable, I edit some partners' code details.
   - create new sprint2 backlog  with team
   
What do I plan to do now?
   - need to design the new CRC cards from New Requirement with team:
     1. Tree
     2. Find
     
   - start the left tasks for sprint 2:
     1. LS 
     2. MAN
     3. Write nice and more comfortable Exception when user input invalid command
     
   - test the whole system before demo day(Week June 26)
   
Am I blocked on anything?
   I didn't understand MOCK system designed by another team mate at first, after some
   talk it is clear.
