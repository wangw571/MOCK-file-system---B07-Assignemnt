Class name: Pushd
Parent class (if any): Command
Responsibilities:
	Saves the current working directory by pushing onto directory stack and
	then changes the new current working directory to DIR. The push must be
	consistent as per the LIFO behavior of a stack. The pushd command
	saves the old current working directory in directory stack so that it can be
	returned to at any time (via the popd command). The size of the directory
	stack is dynamic and dependent on the pushd and the popd commands.
