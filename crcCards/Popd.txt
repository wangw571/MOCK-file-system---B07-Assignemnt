Class name: Popd
Parent class (if any): Command
Responsibilities:
	Remove the top entry from the directory stack, and cd into it. The removal
	must be consistent as per the LIFO behavior of a stack. The popd
	command removes the top most directory from the directory stack and
	makes it the current working directory. If there is no directory onto the
	stack, then give appropriate error message.
