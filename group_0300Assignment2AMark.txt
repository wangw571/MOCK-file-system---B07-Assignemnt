The instructor has increased your assignment 2A letter grade by +2 and your new grade is: B+

Your team's Phase II grade is based on this scale:

    http://www.artsandscience.utoronto.ca/ofr/calendar/rules.htm#grading

The way we graded is as follows: your team starts with an A+. When errors and
problems are found, you will lose 0, 1, 2, or 3 letter steps, depending on the
severity. As an example, if you lost two steps, your team would earn an A-:

     A+ -> A
     A -> A-

You were asked to follow the Scrum process. A big part of that is to maintain
a product backlog and a sprint backlog. 

==== Product and Sprint backlogs ==== [up to -6]

No deductions in this section.

==== Java Style ==== [up to -6]

No deductions in this section.


==== Design ==== [up to -6]

Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

    redirection doesn't easily incorporate new commands -2
		* redirection logic is embedded in Echo
		* which makes it harder to implement redirection to other commands

==== Correctness ==== [up to -6]

    Code doesn't compile without modification (if the fix is simple) -1
		* There are some invalid UTF-8 characters in code which led to compilation error

	[-2] We have deducted -1 for every three failing test cases. 
	
General comments: absolute path is not handled properly in many commands, except /
	
Failed testcases:
1. ls multiple directories
The output format is not following what specified in the handout,
and the output of your program has no way to tell which part belongs to which folder.
 
Input:
mkdir /A
mkdir /A/B
mkdir /A/B/C
ls A A/B
 
Expected output:
A:
B
 
A/B:
C
 
Actual output:
B

C


2. cd absolute path

Input:
mkdir A
cd /A

Expected output:
/# pwd
/A

Actual output:
File:/A
 does not exist!
 

3. pushd absolute path

Input:
mkdir A
pushd /A

Expected output:
/# pwd
/A

Actual output:
directory not exist
	

4. pushd relative path with dots

Input:
mkdir A
mkdir B
cd A
pushd ./B
cd ..
pushd ../A/B

Expected:
/#: pwd
/A/B

Actual:
/#: pushd ./B
directory not exist
/#: pushd ../A/B
directory not exist


5. history with bad argument

Input:
history -100

Expected output:
Invalid command (or some similar error message)

Actual output:

6. history with large number
It should print all history if there is not that many available

Input:
history 100

Expected output:
1. mkdir A
2. cd A
...
80. history 100

Actual output:
Only 80 commands are available, please try again


7. find with absolute path

Input:
mkdir A
cd A
echo "Test" > target
