//Sprint 1 Backlog.
July 10 to July 16

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I want to view the list of files in the current working directory, or a list of all subdirectories.
b) As a user, I don't want to see any exception, only suitable message allowed
c) As a user, I want to use redirection to capture the output of every command and redirect it to a file and no output is shown to me. But all errors are still displayed on the console.
d) As a user, I want to move the item from an old path to a new path by giving relative paths or full paths
e) As a user, I want to copy an item by duplicating the item and placing it in the new path. If it’s a directory, then copy all the contents in it.
f) As a user, I want to get an item from a URL and save it to my current working directory
g) As a user, I want to use an exclamation point following a number n to get the nth input in shell command history
