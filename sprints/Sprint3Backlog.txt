User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I want to save the current working directory by pushing onto directory, stack and then changes the new current working directory by giving a relative path or a full path (Popd Pushd)
b) As a user, I want to print out my recent commands, and truncate the output by specifying a non-negative number(History)
c) As a user, my intention is to view subfile/folder as simple as possible, presenting the entire file relation as a tree, which every subfile/folder is at the right bottom of its parent, subfile/folder in the same level meaning they have a same parent(Tree)
d) As a user, I want to view the list of files in the current working directory(Ls)
e) As a user, I want to print documentation for specific commands(Man)
